# Cpp-Pacman
a cool nostalgic graphical pac-man game written with cpp


## Project Architecture
normally c++ and sfml doesnt offer an architecture for building your apps. it's just a simple straightforward gui library. i needed to implement a simple architecture to give it some discipline and easily maintain the code. 

here's a review from what i've done:

## Views
i also created custom views, implemented with animations(e.g. animation for button click) extended from `view` class implementing it's abstract methods

## Preview
here's some screenshots from game
